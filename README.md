###### 1) 1) Show Date & Time

###### 2) Change HTML Content
    - JavaScript accepts both double and single quotes

###### 3) Change HTML Attribute Values

###### 4) Change HTML CSS Style

###### 5) Hide or Show HTML Elements

###### 6) JS in Script Tags
    - In HTML, JavaScript code is inserted between <script> and </script> tags.
    - Can use scripts in between head or body tags in the HTML file.
    - Placing scripts at the bottom of the <body> element improves the display speed, because script interpretation slows down the display.

###### 7) JS Functions

###### 8) External JS Files
    - You can place an external script reference in <head> or <body> as you like.
    - External scripts cannot contain <script> tags.
    - Placing scripts in external files has some advantages:
        - It separates HTML and code
        - It makes HTML and JavaScript easier to read and maintain
        - Cached JavaScript files can speed up page loads
    - To add several script files to one page  - use several script tags:
        - `<script src="myScript1.js"></script>` `<script src="myScript2.js"></script>`

    - src path can be a url `https://www.w3schools.com/js/myScript1.js` or folder path `/js/myScript1.js`
